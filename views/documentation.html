      <h2>Implementation</h2><br>
      <h3>Game Grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript:</h3>
      This can be found in the grid.js file. Specifically the generateGrid() and genGrid() functions. I assign cells with a class attribute that divides the sudoku grid into the 9 sections.
      <h3>User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons:</h3>
      There is many buttons throughout the application. I also am accepting user input as text
      in the sudoku grid cells.
      <h3>User input in the form of mouse clicks:</h3>
      The user can click on the "?" icon to get hints in the game.
      <h3>Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions:</h3>
      I use innerHTML to generate the grid and also to change the game over screen depending on the outcome of the game.
      <h3>Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page:</h3>
      I am requesting the game board and answer board from https://github.com/berto/sugoku and filling in the grid cells with the generated grid.
      <h3>Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage:</h3>
      The time is saved into local storage, that way the game can be paused. It also displays their game time on the Game Over screen.
      <h3>Game logic code:</h3>
      You should be able to complete the sudoku game. You are only allowed 3 mistakes and can receive 3 hints. Correct answers will stay blue and incorrect answers will turn red.
